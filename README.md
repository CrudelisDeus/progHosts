# Program "Hosts"
## The program serves for convenient management of the hosts file, without powershell modules <br>
*Created for himself, but maybe someone will be useful*
## Getting started with the program
- It runs through **Run.bat**. Runs script on behalf of the administrator, to successfully execute the command.
- **Uninstall.bat** removes the working directory "C:\data\program\progHosts", which serves to save the hosts file.
## Program interface
### Main meny
The main menu contains options for adding a DNS record, viewing the contents of a hosts file, or removing a DNS record. <br>

### RM menu
Removes DNC records, as well as saving the host file to the working directory. <br>
Deletion occurs by DNS name. <br>
**The script does not contain a user input check, because I donâ€™t think this script will be used by anyone other than me, so be careful.** <br>
